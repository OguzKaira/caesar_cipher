# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Tool

This tool allows you to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to input text, choose encryption or decryption, and set the shift value.

## Security Disclaimer

Caution: Caesar Cipher is a basic and historically significant encryption method. However, it is not secure for modern use and should not be relied upon for sensitive information. It is susceptible to various attacks, and there are more advanced encryption algorithms available for secure communication.

This tool is created for educational purposes and to demonstrate the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It should not be used for real-world encryption needs. For secure applications, consider using well-established cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar_chiper.git
   cd caesar_cipher
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted.
   - Choose 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.
   - Enter the shift value for the Caesar cipher (an integer).

4. **View the Result:**
   The tool will display the encrypted or decrypted text based on your input.

## Additional Notes

- The `getpass` module is used to securely input the text, ensuring that the input is not visible on the screen.
- If an invalid input is provided, the tool will prompt you to enter the information again.
- If a non-integer value is entered for the shift, an error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to enter the shift value again.

Feel free to customize the script or improve its features based on your needs!
